# ProjectTelekinesis
Code used for Senior Capstone project "Project Telekinesis"
This code can be used to train an AI model on intended actions using a Muse 2 EEG.

If a user has never used Telekinesis before, the first program to run is TeleDataPKL.py. This program will collect data for each intended action from the EEG.
After running TeleDataPKL.py, TeleRNNPKL.py should be run to train an AI on the recorded data.
If a user has trained an AI on their data, TeleRoverConnection should be run to connect the EEG to the rover through the AI.
